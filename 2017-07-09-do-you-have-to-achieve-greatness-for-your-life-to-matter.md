# Dear Alma: Do You Have to Achieve Greatness for Your Life to Matter?

After the movie *The Social Network* came out, I saw a post on the internet written by a teenager who said he had seen the movie and already knew he would never achieve Mark Zuckerberg's level of greatness. The spirit of his post was, "I'll never be that great, so what is the point of life?"

I pondered his question for seven years, and now I have finished thinking about it. This letter is for you, in case you ever ask the same question and I'm not around to give you my answer.

Also, about that answer. I have no platitudes to offer. Instead, I have a few short thought experiments that could make you uncomfortable, and a *lot* of questions. I hope that your mind dwells on these questions over the next couple of days. With any luck, they will lead you to the answer you seek.

## First Thought Experiment

What if I rephrased the question like this:

**Unless you achieve greatness, your life will be meaningless.**

Did you get the sense that the statement was already present in your mind, and I only reminded you of it? If you look closely at the idea, can you tell where it came from? Was there one source or many?

Imagine for a moment that the statement is true. You're an old woman looking back at her life. You did many things, but you didn't achieve true greatness.

How did that feel? If it didn't bother you at all, then my work is already done. Otherwise, we are going to examine very closely the suffering that this idea can cause, and a way out.

## Nothingness, the Eternal Soul, and Reincarnation

You may believe that after death, there is nothingness, or that your soul is eternal, you'll be resurrected, reincarnated, or any number of things. I won't disagree with any of those beliefs in this letter.

## When Does Death Begin?

Instead of talking about when life ends, I want you to consider when death begins. I know, I know. Death?! But let's go there for a moment.

## Third Thought Experiment

As you read this, is it closer to the time you woke up today, or the time you'll go to sleep? If it's closer to the time you woke up, are you the same person today as the person who went to sleep? Is today the same day as yesterday? (You're five years old now and ask me this all the time; it's a valid question.)

If the time is closer to when you'll go to sleep, will the person who wakes up tomorrow be the same as the one who goes to sleep? More silly questions, you're probably thinking. But again, tomorrow we'll say that the day is different, right? So are you the same person, or different? Could both statements be true? What is the difference between a day and a person's life?

## 188 Deaths

What would it even mean if you were a different person after you woke up? Does that mean someone else died the night before? If that's the case, how many times did you die already? This is just for fun; clearly you aren't dead if you're reading this. But let's continue the experiment. If you did die all those times, how many is it exactly? So far just this year, for me, it would be, what, 188 deaths, give or take a few?

Of course, we both know that going to sleep isn't the same as the death of the body, and I won't insult your intelligence by claiming that they are alike. But let's continue the experiment. Aside from the complexity of your brain, what are the similarities and differences between the moment your body was born from your mother's womb and the moment you gained consciousness today?

Oops! I said I would only talk about death, and then I meandered back to birth. "Back" to birth doesn't sound right, does it?

## How Long is a Life?

You may already be familiar with these questions. If you aren't yet, they may sound absurd.

Odd as the questions are, the central conflict in the pro-life/pro-choice debate is the definition of exactly *when* life begins. Does it begin at the moment of conception, or later? Does it begin even earlier, before conception? 

This essay is not about that debate and we won't address it, but clearly, our ideas about the moment that life begins -- and thus about the duration of life -- are important enough to warrant decades of entrenched conflict. These are serious questions!

## Fourth Thought Experiment

Given that these silly questions are actually very serious, let's keep experimenting with them.

What if, instead of life beginning at the moment of conception or sometime later, it began when you woke up today? Really let that possibility sink into your imagination.

Imagine that you came into existence when you woke up this morning and you'll change into a different being after you go sleep. In other words, you have around twelve hours to make your life meaningful. Damn, not a lot of time! What do you do, right?

Now, what if you went even further: what if it was only an hour? How would you make an hour-long life meaningful?

These questions are worth setting some time aside to think about deeply. However, you may want to wait until we're done with the other thought experiments because we're about to think bigger.

## What Makes a Life?

So far, we've drawn a box around your life and imagined different numbers. When we started, your life-span was probably seventy years; then it was 24 hours, and finally a single hour. But in all these cases, regardless of the length of time, what makes up the substance of the life that you control?

This time I want to push an answer on you: Your actions. I hope we can agree that your actions are what you control in life, and that certain types of actions make up what is generally referred to as "greatness." Great people have done great things; it appears that they've taken certain actions and achieved results.

Here are examples of what most people would probably call "greatness":

- The winner of a gold metal at the Olympics, or a career athlete who wins ten Olympic gold medals
- The founder of a very successful company, or a serial entrepreneur who creates many successful companies
- The author of a well-received and long-remembered novel, or a novelist who writes many such novels

You get the idea, right? Some people are great because of a single event, while others experience more than one such event. To someone who views achieving greatness as the point of life, looking into another's life from the outside, even a single such event may seem like it has made the person's life meaningful. Logically, more of these events should equal more greatness, and thus more meaning.

We are truly in the thick of it now. Let's continue from the basis that a life is made of actions.

## Fifth Thought Experiment

I want you to consider two scenarios:

- A child learning how to play a cello gives a bad performance in front of an audience. Other than her parents, few people give positive comments, and she leaves the stage. You are in the audience, empathize with the child, and approach her afterward to give honest praise about her hard work. She thanks you, and you promptly forget about the episode. The girl continues practicing. She remembers that day as her first public embarrassment, and she ruminates about it often. With the pain, though, she always remembers you. In fact, she remembers your kind words seven hundred times, and each time pushes her to practice harder. Later, she joins an ensemble that comes to be known as the one of the greatest of its generation. Ten thousand people's broken hearts are consoled by this music.

- Two candidates run for a political office. One supports better funding of mental health care services. You vote for him. The vote is close; a handful of people decide the election for the man you chose. Soon after, you move to another country and never return. While the politician is in office, he at first tries to back away from his campaign promises, but after pressure from a coalition of mental health advocates and his wife, a devout Catholic, he begins working on legislation that would revamp the mental health care system. The legislation passes. Thousands of people see an increase in quality of life, happiness, and meaning as a result. One hundred that would have died within five years without the new plan live instead.

How many actions were involved in producing the great things done in these examples?


## A Flash of Lightning

Greatness is like a flash of lightning that appears in the world when the conditions are right. Are the clouds great because they generated lightning, or is the tree that it sets on fire great for receiving it?
