I'm Andrew Brookins from Portland, Oregon. I'm a family guy,
writer, and programmer. In my free time, I meditate and run a Dungeons and
Dragons game. I'm also obsessed with iPads I guess?

Continue reading for all the juicy details.

## Writing

I've been writing as long as I can remember. My latest book is [The Temple of
Django Database
Performance](https://spellbookpress.com/books/temple-of-django-database-performance/).
If you're a Django developer, you should totally buy it!

## Software Development

Since 2008, I've been a [software
developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbrookins/). When I want the job to
sound impressive, I call it "software engineering."

A couple of years ago, I [charted ten years of learning investments](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/ten-years-of-learning-investments/) related to my career.

A lot of my experience is with Python. I [compared mixins in Ruby and
Python](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/mixins-in-python-and-ruby-compared/)
recently. I've also [explored how Django's StreamingHttpResponse works](https://andrewbrookins.com/django/how-does-djangos-streaminghttpresponse-work-exactly/).

Most recently, I spent a few years building [cloud-hosted databases on
Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases) at IBM. I've just started a
new role at [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/), where I teach people about
Redis. (Awesome, right?!)

Lately I've been mulling our industry's ethical dillemmas, as have many software
developers. I wrote about [using a conceptual framework centered on the "common
good" to build a code of ethics for software engineers](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/what-are-we-doing-here-software-engineering/).

I am especially aware of service reliability. I built an outage simulator to help
visualize these concepts and then wrote a [confusing blog
post](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/demonstrating-stability-patterns-with-an-outage-simulator/)
about the topic. Someday I'll make it better.

## Family

In my free time I kick it with my family (photo below). Our first daughter was
born in 2012, and our second was born in 2019. They're both absolutely bonkers,
and I love them.

I've written a few public letters to my first daughter, like [Dear Alma: How to
Quit Drinking](https://andrewbrookins.com/life/dear-alma-how-to-quit-drinking/).

## iPads
    
I don't know what it is about iPads, but I'm kind of obsessed with them. I tried
coding on an iPad Pro [in
2019](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/coding-on-ipad-pro-2019/) and an
iPad Air 2 [in 2017](https://andrewbrookins.com/tech/can-you-write-code-on-an-ipad/).

I'm not sure why this appeals to me, even after reading [my own
post](https://andrewbrookins.com/tech/my-ideal-software-development-environment/)
on the subject. I blame [Rob Pike](https://usesthis.com/interviews/rob.pike/).
