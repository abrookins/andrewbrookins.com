I'm Andrew Brookins. I write about Apple, iOS, iPadOS, and programming.

Continue reading for all the juicy details.

## iPads

I'm obsessed with iPads, iOS, and how people get serious work done with mobile technology.

I tried
coding on an iPad Pro [in
2019](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/coding-on-ipad-pro-2019/) and an
iPad Air 2 [in 2017](https://andrewbrookins.com/tech/can-you-write-code-on-an-ipad/).

After ten years writing software, I now work as a writer and video producer (and I still code!), so in the future I'll explore the iPad and iPhone as a tool for media work.

## Books

My latest book is [The Temple of
Django Database
Performance](https://spellbookpress.com/books/temple-of-django-database-performance/).
If you're a Django developer, you should totally buy it!

## Software Development

I worked for ten years as a professional software developer, and many of my past blog posts detailed that world.

A couple of years ago, I [charted ten years of learning investments](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/ten-years-of-learning-investments/) related to my career.

A lot of my programming experience is with Python. I [compared mixins in Ruby and
Python](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/mixins-in-python-and-ruby-compared/). I've also [explored how Django's StreamingHttpResponse works](https://andrewbrookins.com/django/how-does-djangos-streaminghttpresponse-work-exactly/).

Lately I've been mulling our industry's ethical dillemmas, as have many software
developers. I wrote about [using the "common
good" as an idea around which to center the ethics of software engineering](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/what-are-we-doing-here-software-engineering/).

Many software problems end up being about how an app or service handles outages. I built an outage simulator to help visualize this concept and then wrote a [blog
post](https://andrewbrookins.com/technology/demonstrating-stability-patterns-with-an-outage-simulator/) about it.

## Family

In my free time I kick it with my family (photo below). Our first daughter was
born in 2012, and our second was born in 2019. They're both absolutely bonkers,
and I love them.

I've written a few public letters to my first daughter, like [Dear Alma: How to
Quit Drinking](https://andrewbrookins.com/life/dear-alma-how-to-quit-drinking/).
