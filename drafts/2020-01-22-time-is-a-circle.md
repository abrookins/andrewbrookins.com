The first record we have of a device that tells time is the Shadow Clock used by Egyptians 3500 years ago.

Shadow clocks work by the same mechanism as sun dials: they stand in the light of the sun, casting a shadow that points to the current time. The shadow moves as the sun appears to drift across the sky, which we now Know is due to the earth rotating in space on its axis. The Egyptians and sundial makers represented this movement as points on a circular dial.

When mechanical clocks appeared, they retained this
dial, now powered by gears and housed behind glass.
After docks came pocket watches, and then "Watch bracelets," made popular by soldiers in World War 1 who needed faster access to time than clocks put away on a chain.

with the rise of smartphones, watches declined. Most young people don't wear watches- who needs a watch when you're already carrying a phone that tells time? This was my experience. For several years, I only used the clocks on my mobile phones, computers, and appliances. And every one of these was digital.

But many of us continue to learn the time from watches. And in an age when our watches are computers able to communicate across an entire world, one still finds a circle. Disembodied hours, minutes, and seconds hands float around glowing circles on electronic displays. Are these simulations of the analog world a reflection of humanity's reluctance to tran send the past?

No. Tine has a geography. A day's passing tracks the earth's rotation on its axis. We orbit the sun, incurring seasons. A shadow drifts across the dial and returns the next day. Time is a circle.

Yet our devices so oft en use digital clocks. Numbers are useful for precision, but consider what we lose. Glance at a circle whose minutes hand is anywhere near the "b" on an analog clock: half an hour has passed, and on seeing this one can feel the shape of time. H al f and a sliver more, or a sliver less. Gaze at "a quarter til": without even seeing the numbers, ve know the hour is slipping away. Quarters, halves, wholes: time has a geography, a geometry, a physicality, a presence. All of this is lost the moment we think of time as a number, when instead of measuring between two times by a familiar shape -a twenty- minute-sized- wedge, let's say- we calculate.

There is a place in ourlines for both modalities. As smart watches grow more popular, it becomes easier to switch between the two: one activity assigned a digital face, another an analog. And the Apple Watch especially has created innovative dual nodes that are promising: timer representations that display digits and circles that empty as the timer counts down, watch faces that combine a digital portion with an analog.

This duality and hybridization of the analog and digital creates a better watch -setting aside all the other fancy features, the text messaging, the GPS tracking, the music player. Simply to fold the geography of time -left behind by digital watches since the 1980s - back into human life, circles
