Several choices I've made in my life have felt like major turning points. I had no idea how they would turn out, and the possibility of failure seemed immense and long-lasting. Whenever I faced a choice that scared me like this, part of me wanted to back out instead of risk it, but instead I tried to think of the choice as an experiment that would produce results. After all, you can do things with results. You can evaluate and act on them. You have choices.

I've started enough of these experiments that I wanted to take a moment and review some of the results. These are major life events like marriage, fatherhood, and getting sober, along with smaller changes like switching programming languages and trying management. So, let's see where these choices took me!

## Marriage

Would marrying the woman who became my wife make me happy?

I remember the moment I decided to marry Kim. It was six a.m. and I was sitting on the patio of our room at a modest inn on the Oregon coast, where you could hear, but not see, the ocean. We hadn't been dating long. The night before, I drank too much beer and fell asleep early, so little did I know that as I pondered the future of our relationship, she was doubting it!

So, what were the results? Well, it turns out marriage is one of the hardest things I've ever done, second only to parenthood. Neither Kim nor I could have realized just how _different_ we actually were until we were pressed together in a small apartment, dealing with college homework, finances from a shared bank account, and our jobs in childcare (her) and a non-profit (me). And there is really no getting around it: in 2008, despite all my intentions, I was a shady dude. I had no idea how to communicate genuinely or be honest with people, and I had a heartache that went very deep.

Getting married in our early twenties added extra difficulty. Money was tight and our identities -- especially mine -- were still forming. In our first year of marriage, I got sober, launched my programming career mostly by accident and due to obsession, dropped out of work on an English degree, and abandoned my identity as an "important writer in-progress." Kim graduated with a 4.0 GPA and started working, got into veganism and exercise, and had to weather the storm of my
