## The Temple of Django Database Performance

I wrote the book on [Django database
performance](https://spellbookpress.com/books/temple-of-django-database-performance/).

And this is not just another boring technical book: it's a mashup of deep technical content and fantasy table-top gaming.

One reader described it like this:

> The Temple of Django Database Performance is a must read for anyone working with Django. Youâ€™ll learn about profiling, query plans, indexing, and the Django ORM. Very approachable for those with only modest experience but even the experts should learn something new.
>
> -- Tristan Waddington, Developer Experience Lead
