I wrote a post recently on the [Safari blog](http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/), this time about [how to protect against bias while hiring](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2015/02/09/protect-against-bias-while-hiring/).

I often interview candidates at Safari, and I take that responsibility very seriously. My post describes actions that people can take at all stages of hiring to protect applicants from bias, both conscious and unconscious.
