I'm coming up on ten years as a professional software developer. One tip I learned from reading _Practical Thinking and Learning_ was to treat learning as an investment, and to consider your skills a kind of portfolio that you monitor over time. This post reviews the most notable learning investments I've made in the past decade and my subjective assessment of the returns.

If you just want to see a graph, scroll down; otherwise, feel free to read how I magically produced the numbers.

## The Return on Investment (ROI) formula

Not being someone who makes investments _other_ than skills, I had to look up the Return on Investment formula:

> To calculate ROI, the benefit (or return) of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment, and the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.

-- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp)

The "benefit" of the investment is expressed as gain minus cost.

## How do you measure the benefit of skill investments?

After deciding to create a graph for this data, I ran into a problem: I actually had no data and zero idea how to measure the returns on skill investments. Some of the skills I'd invested in had financial benefit, while others yielded gains purely in happiness. Somehow, I needed to create numbers for both types of investment.

To deal with this ambiguity, I created a measurement called Happiness Units. I listed each skill and devised a Happiness Unit rating based on four factors: satisfaction, joy, stability (financial or otherwise), and benefit to others. The sum of these factors would be the gain from the skill. 

With that out of the way, I gave a rough estimate of the energy I'd invested in the skill, as its "cost," and recorded the age of the investment (roughly speaking, the date I began learning). That was enough to graph the results.

Happiness ROI for a skill, then, would be the gain in Happiness Units minus the cost in energy, divided by the cost. Those were enough numbers to produce an obviously unscientific, but still interesting, graph.

## Graphing the results

I chose a bubble graph to represent these learning investments, so that I could see the energy invested alongside returns. In the graph, the x axis is the age of the skill investment, the y axis is the ROI, and z axis (the size of each bubble) is the energy invested.

    The first language I was paid to work with. I poured hundreds of hours into learning it and the forms-based web development patterns common at the time, only to abandon it for Python after a couple of years.

  <p id="python">
    I learned Python early in my career, at the same time that it became super popular. I've never had trouble finding Python work since. In addition, it's a joyous language that taught me a deep respect for the craft of programming.

  <p id="meditation">
    Meditation saved me during a period of depression I experienced after becoming a father. (To call parenting "difficult" would be a criminal misuse of English.) My tecnical skill investments declined rapidly around year 5, when my daughter was born. However, I began investing deeply in high-returning non-technical skills, the most important of which was meditation. If my career imploded tomorrow, I would be happy with the increased time I had to meditate. If you can find an activity like that to invest in, do it post-haste.
  </p>

  <p id="d&d">
    My antidote to technical and parenting burn-out is one part meditation and another part Dungeons & Dragons. (Really, tabletop role-playing games in general, but I'll generalize the topic to D&D.) It's an analog activity that I do face-to-face with friends and an absolute minimum of technology. It took a while to learn how to play my part -- the "Dungeon Master," or game referee -- but now that I have it down, my D&D games are a bright spot in every month. I can't recommend it highly enough, as a kind of uber-game that can become anything you want: turn-based strategy, social/acting improv, immersive story-telling platform -- truly anything.

  <p id="ruby">
    I used Ruby briefly early in my career, but dropped it for Python. Recently, however, I decided to tour some non-Python languages professionally, beginning with Ruby. The slight investment I've made in it has paid off pretty handsomely, with an interesting job working for IBM.
