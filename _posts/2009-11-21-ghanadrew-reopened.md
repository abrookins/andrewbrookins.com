This month I reopened the blog I wrote on my trip to Ghana in 2006, in an archived state and with a short introduction.

[<img src="https://andrewbrookins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/egg-village-3-300x1991.jpg" alt="" title="Egg Village, Ghana" width="300" height="199" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-60" />](https://andrewbrookins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/egg-village-31.jpg)

The original title of the blog was &#8220;Ghanadrew,&#8221; which I kept for the archive. Â You can read it online at:
