The video of my first _ever_ conference talk is now available on YouTube. [Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfSCdu0y6s) or watch it below. It could have been better, but least now my daughter will always be able to find a video of her dad looking foolish on the internet. 



The talk was a look at different web services libraries that the Safari Books Online team has used to implement backend services, including vanilla Django views, Piston, TastyPie and Django Rest Framework.

The [talk abstract](http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/17/) is also online at the DjangoCon site if you’re interested.

I’m interested in feedback on my delivery, the subject of the talk and anything else you found notable. I learned a lot and hope to improve for my next talk, assuming I can find someone to accept another one.
