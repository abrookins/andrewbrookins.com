My favorite board game _ever_ has to be Aliens, published in 1989 by Leading Edge Games.

If you&#8217;ve never played it, there is a [Flash adaptation](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/408816) available, which seems to be free. 

I was introduced to the game in the early 90s by the same guy who taught me how to play Dungeons & Dragons &#8211; an afterschool counselor named Juan. Thus I entered the hallowed halls of Geekery. On the days Juan worked, a group of Aliens-addicted kids would beg him to break out the game and let us try the suicide mission of the Reactor Room or the even-deadlier Operations & Air Ducts. 

I don&#8217;t remember if we ever &#8220;won&#8221; the game (a certain number of characters have to survive for that to happen), but the taste of imminent-if-unrealized-victory and the crazy teamwork the game inspired left a lasting impression on me. 

The game was out of print even when I first played. For years, as a teenager, I looked for it in comic and hobby shops around southern California, to no avail. So I gave up &#8211; and time went on, as it does. Then, several years ago, I started trolling Ebay, and I eventually snagged a good condition set for $70. Apparently it had become a collector&#8217;s item.

Since then, I have played it three times (and won twice). The last was tonight, with my wife, who for some odd reason felt compelled to indulge me. 

Unpacking the box, I felt like that same excited middle-school kid explaining all of the rules to her: the aliens&#8217; acid spray, the characters&#8217; movement, the layout of the board. I remembered Juan explaining the same rules to me, so many years ago.

It&#8217;s a goofy game, sure &#8211; a Sci-Fi combat strategy. But it&#8217;s fast-paced and fun, and I consider it part of my childhood. After all, I spent so many days and nights thinking through possible ways to beat the game &#8211; more time than I spent on my homework! And you can&#8217;t beat the team play in a game that forces you to carry around incapacitated team members to win.

So, about tonight &#8230; Maybe having a new recruit set me back, but when we finally called it quits, we were down four characters. All of them were mine! Part of the reason, I think, was that after a bad run-in with some aliens in the southeastern quadrant of the board, I retreated my team and we changed from a split formation tactic into one group. Always a bad move. 

If you play the game, I suggest splitting into two columns, and remember to always bring either Drake or Vasquez.
