The first program written for a computer ran June 21, 1948 on the Manchester Mark 1[^1]. By that measurement, software engineers have been writing code for seventy years. What was the point of all that work? This is not a frivolous question. Our profession’s ability to answer it grows more vital every day, as nearly every aspect of modern life comes to rely on the software we write.

The problem is not a lack of potential answers, for there are many. Venture capitalists want us to think that our purpose is create high-growth companies that make ourselves -- and the VCs -- more money. Product companies enjoy an even simpler idea: our work only gains meaning when we spend the money produced by doing it. And let's not forget the media companies that portray us as job destroyers, even if automation has historically created new and different jobs.

There is a war raging for our souls as soon as we step into the arena. No matter what, we all adopt a view of this work, for better or worse. However, there is one answer to the question, "What are we doing here?" that has more power and meaning than any others.
