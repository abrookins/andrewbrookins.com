The night sky above I-5 was devoid of stars as I drove to meet the ghost hunters. My destination? I signed an agreement never to reveal its name.

I can tell you it was a few hours northwest of Portland, Oregon, on a long spit abutting the coast. Somewhere on that foggy stretch was an old hotel whose staff, terrified by recent wailing and window-scratchings, had invited a team of paranormal investigators to visit late at night. I was coming along for the story.

After an hour driving in the dark I had begun feeling nervous not about ghosts, but about the investigators. Who were they? Was this all just a ruse? The hotel, when it appeared from the fog that swirled along that quiet stretch of land so close to the ocean, did not help my courage: crumbling white stucco sculpture adorned its walls, and the signage -- wooden, painted -- was dilapidated. My pulse quickened.

The team gave me instructions to park near one of the hotel's buildings and meet them in the lot. Under no circumstances was I to visit the front desk.

Worse than the appearance of the old hotel was the cell reception. The team's instructions made little sense to me after I arrived, and without a signal I couldn't call them. I parked and became aware of how little I had brought to this meeting: barely enough gas, a flip phone that was now useless, a small notebook, a black gel pen.

I walked around the lot, which was nearly empty that night, hoping the right people would notice me.  After twenty minutes I went to the front office, breaking protocol. The sleepy attendant gave me a run-down of room prices (they were expensive), but I wasn't listening. I said I'd think on it, left the office, and walked again into the darkness.

Not long afterward, a man found me.

He had short, straight black hair. Younger than I expected. He made his apologies and ushered me toward one of the hotel rooms. These rooms had external entrances. I braced myself.

"You didn't go to the office, right?" he said.

I gripped the pen in my pocket.

"No."

"Good. The staff asked us not to. This way."

He opened the door and we walked in. The interior was smoky. A woman sat on a black couch, smoking a cigarette.  She was young, like the investigator. A man sat next to her. They both had embarrassed smiles on their faces.

"This is Andrew," the investigator from the parking lot said. "He's the writer."

"Hey," the man on the couch said.

"you're not going to mention the hotel's name, right?" the woman said.

"No."

"We'd get in a lot of trouble."

"Mm hmm," I mumbled, writing in my notebook.

TODO: What did they see?

"You want a drink?" the man on the couch asked.

For the first time, I re­alized that the two had glasses on a table in front of them and a bottle of vodka. Condensation beaded on the surface of the bottle. The smoke in the air grated at my throat.

"No thanks," I said, waving my hand.

I looked away. The room was large, pooling around a kitchenette.

Someone called out from a hallway. "We're almost ready!"

TODO: Describe equipment more.

The investigator from the parking lot -- let's call him Dale -- showed me around the rest of the suite. In one room, they had stacked various cameras, tripods,
and electro-magnetic-field (EMF) sensors. In another room, a second investigator sat with headphones, listening to a digital audio recorder. Various microphones lay on the floor.

"Matt," he said, shaking my hand.

I gave him my name.

He grinned. "You should hear this."

He took off his headphones and offered them to me.

Until this point, I had wondered if I could go the whole night without entering into this reality. Everyone in the room be­lieved in the existence and current presence of ghosts. They had invited me to participate. What were they going to get in return?

Would my skepticism act as a ground to that current, completing a circuit with another dimension? Or would I resist?

Parapsychologists, paranormal investigators, and -- to use a more casual moniker -- ghost hunters often make audio recordings during an investigation.

Recording audio ghost phenomena dates back to the early 20th century. The psychologist Konstantin Raudive popularized it with his 1968 book _Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead_.

What do these recordings actually capture? Typically, hours of static. When that static includes noises that a listener identifies as language, a paranormal investigator would consider that portion of the recording "electronic voice phenomena" (EVP). In other words, the voice of a ghost.

TODO: EVP example recording. With spectrogram if possible.

When I donned Matt's head phones, I didn't know any of this. Cosmic static flooded my ears. He guided me to a laptop and pointed at a spectrogram. As his finger traced a black arc, I thought I heard breathing.
