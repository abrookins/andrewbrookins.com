I was sober the night I met the ghost hunters.

I drove up I-5 through a night devoid of stars in the bruised Ford pickup my father gave me before he died. The destination? I signed an agreement never to reveal its name.

I can tell you it was a few hours northwest of Portland, Oregon, on a long spit abutting the coast. Somewhere on that foggy stretch is a very old hotel whose staff, terrified by recent wailing and window-scratchings, had invited a team of paranormal investigators late at night to visit. I was coming along to write the story.

The team gave me instructions to meet to park near one of the hotel's buildings and meet them in the lot - under no circumstances should I use the front desk.

After an hour driving in the dark I had begun feeling nervous not about the potential for meeting
ghosts, but about just who these investigators
were. The hotel, when it appeared from the fog that swirled along that quiet stretch of land so close to the ocean, did not help my courage: it was a decent setting for a horror movie; white stucco sculpture adorned its walls, and the signage -- wooden, painted -- was dilapidated. My pulse quickened.

But worse than the app­earance of this old hotel was the cell reception. The team's instructions made little sense to me after I arrived, and without a signal I couldn't call them. I parked the truck and felt very aware of how little I had brought to this meeting: barely enough
gas, a flip phone that was now useless, a small notebook,
a black gel pen.

I walked around the lot, which was crowded that night, hoping the right people would notice me.  After twenty minutes I even went to the front office-breaking protocol
- to ask about room prices. The sleepy att­endant gave me a run­down (it was ex-pensive) but I wasn't listening. I said I'd think on it, left the office, and walked again into the harkness.

Not long afterward, a man found me.

He had short, straight black hair. Younger than I expected. He made his apologies and ushered me toward one of the rooms. Here we go, I thought: murder time.

"You didn't go to the office, right?" he said.

I gripped the pen in my pocket.

"No."
"Good. They asked us not to. This way."

He opened the door to a room, and we walked in.  The interior was smoky. A woman sat on a black couch, smoking a cigarette.  She was young too. A man was next to her.  They both had embarrassed smiles on their faces.

"This is Andrew," the investigator from the parking lot said.  "He's the writer."
