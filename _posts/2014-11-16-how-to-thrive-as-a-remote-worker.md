I wrote a post this week about remote work, specifically how to avoid going crazy and losing your job when employed as such, on [Safari’s corporate blog](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/11/15/thrive-remote-developer/).

Now that I’ve worked for more than three years as a fully remote developer, I have a lot of advice to share based on hard-won experience. Several posts on the topic are kicking around my head, so depending on response to my post at Safari I may follow up with more.
