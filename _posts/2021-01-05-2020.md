This is a long, mostly stream-of-conscious post about 2020.

## The end of 2019

After our second daughter was born in May 2019, I took paternity leave. That year is now a blur, partly because of sleep deprivation, but I recall that during my leave a feeling weighed on me, not about parenthood, with which I was by then well acquainted, but about work: something was *wrong*.

While the projects I worked on at IBM were interesting -- my team, IBM Cloud Databases, built and operated a databases-as-a-service product -- I felt like I used only a fraction of my total ability at work. The job wasn't much different than others I'd had as a software developer: a mix of video status check-ins and planning sessions, interspersed with long hours of solo programming. But a niggling feeling that I was out of place had finally grown into *Something is deeply wrong*.

The problem wasn't boredom. I fell in love with databases at IBM -- for the first time in my career I'd finally found "my thing." I was also constantly learning, and spent most of 2019 working seriously with Go and Kubernetes for the first time. Building programs at work satisfied my deep desire to create. So I kept asking myself: what's wrong exactly, if it isn't boredom?

While on paternity leave, in between taking care of our new infant, I read _What Color Is Your Parachute_, a classic book for job-seekers. I wasn't looking for a job. Instead, I was trying to understand why I felt out of place in the job I had.

And the key insight I took away from the book was to look closely at the things I enjoyed doing outside of work. Which led me to the following list:

* Writing (stories, blog posts, a technical book)
* Organizing book clubs
* Running Dungeons and Dragons games

Not for the first time, I realized in compiling this list that while my primary activity is often creating things, I enjoy connecting with people just as much. Running D&D games in particular is a lot of work, and sometimes I'd rather skip game night and get some extra sleep, but I try to always do the game unless my wife or I are sick. I run the game because seeing my friends makes me feel good. And, sometimes more importantly, I like to think that seeing seeing each other and getting an escape from daily life makes them feel good.

In a similar vein, I realized that writing technical content also gives me a sense of meaning and purpose: I love finding out that something I wrote helped someone's career. The idea that I can help someone find the stability and safety that often comes from work is profoundly meaningful and motivating.

One of the messages in _Parachute_ is that finding your "purpose" in life is often about recognizing what you're already good at, or what you already spend time doing. After reading the book, I suspected that I'd feel more satisfied with my work if I could create things with technology but also connect with people and help develop their careers. What kind of job would let me do that, I wasn't sure -- I'd tried management a few years earlier, with mixed results.

Jump forward a few months, and I applied to a job I did not know existed and would not have considered had I never read _Parachute_: "Curriculum Software Engineer" at Redis Labs. I'd build automation for the Redis University site, contribute to open-source libraries in the Redis ecosystem, and build educational content.

After meeting the team, I accepted an offer and started work. It was January, 2020.

## Covid begins

In January I visited the Redis Labs office in Mountain View, California. I was born in CA, so the chance to Mountain View regularly was a big perk of the job.

While there, I spent time in the studio, ate meals with my colleagues, and met a lot of people. I didn't sleep well, and the trip was a bit hectic -- I didn't feel prepared to record video about Redis yet! -- but I enjoyed meeting everyone.

When I came home, a news story caught my eye: one of the first known  U.S. cases of the "novel Coronavirus" had been traced to someone who was in San Jose International Airport on the same day I'd passed through.

I worried about this for a few days, but decided the chance that I'd been exposed was low. Several days later, though, I got sick.

If I did have Covid, my symptoms were mild and manageable -- I figured it was just a bad cold, or the flu. I felt extremely lethargic and confused for two weeks, unable to get out of bed on the worst days. But that was all -- and eventually I recovered.

By mid-February I felt better, but by then the reality that Covid was a global pandemic had settled in. My wife and I anxiously watched case counts and new outbreaks. She worked in a hospital, and I worried for her safety if a major outbreak ever hit Oregon.

In March, Portland Public Schools canceled in-person classes. We started the work of juggling distance learning with two jobs that we continue to do today, nine very long months later.

## Smoke age

At some point in the winter of 2019-2020, my wife and I sleep-trained our baby. For the non-parents out there, this means that, like monsters, we let her cry in a dark room until she was able to get herself back to sleep during the night.

We could never bring ourselves to sleep train our first daughter -- letting your baby scream in apparent agony goes against every human parental feeling. We figured that she would eventually learn how to sleep through the night. However, she never did, and we endured years of sleep deprivation, night-time arguments ("GO. BACK. TO. SLEEP!"), and total despair. The prospect of going through that again seemed unendurable -- worse for everyone than some up-front agony.

As a result of sleep-training our baby, we were finally able to sleep again. Our oldest daughter continued to have problems sleeping, but at least we could reliably get a few hours between the two of them.

However, the was a cost: I had to give up my office. The house we lived in had three bedrooms, one of which was my office. Everything we read suggested that as part of sleep training, we should transition our baby into her own room.

So in early 2020, when the pandemic started ramping up, I was working in an office near our house, which I was more or less happy with. But by April, working out of the home seemed irresponsible, and potentially dangerous, so I packed up my stuff and started working at home again.

The only problem was, there was nowhere to work. I set up my desk in the landing of the stairway that led to my oldest daughter's room upstairs. It was the worst possible place to focus, visible from the busiest area in the downstairs portion of the house -- the hallway between our baby's room and the single bathroom in the house -- while also absorbing noise from my oldest daughter's room like a sponge.
