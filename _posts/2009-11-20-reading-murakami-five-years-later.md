<p style="text-align: left;">
  Kim and I have been reading <em>The Wind-up Bird Chronice</em>, one of Haruki Murakami&#8217;s best-known novels, for the past couple of months.  It has taken us a long time to get half-way through the book.  This is my second reading, and I am surprised to find that the author&#8217;s style, themes and approach leave me feeling a sense of distance that verges on yawning boredom.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I was the one who pushed for this book on our reading list, so I am a little shocked at  my response.  Murakami has meant and continues to mean a great deal to me as a writer.  The first stories I wrote as a young adult were little more than imitations of Murakami (and, to a lesser extent, Raymond Carver).  I doubt I am alone in my generation in saying that those two authors were my greatest early inspirations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I know the exact month and year I first read <em>Wind-up Bird.</em> It was between March and April of 2003, during the US &#8220;Shock and Awe&#8221; military campaign in Iraq.  That was back when Portland&#8217;s anti-war marches drew thousands of people, and I was one of those young men who never missed a demonstration, partly out of ill will and of course partly from a desire to witness conflict.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Sometime after the initial US bombing of Baghdad, I read one of the long chapters in <em>Wind-up Bird</em> that describes Japan&#8217;s invasion of Manchuria.  The chapter was horrifying.  Soviet soldiers take the Japanese narrator and his party hostage, then torture and kill one of them by skinning the man alive.  Murakami&#8217;s own apparent self-searching over Japan&#8217;s responsibility for the atrocities of the Manchurian War struck home with me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now, though, I am bored by them.  And when I am not bored I am simply irritated: &#8220;Why are you repeating yourself, Murakami?  Do you care about May Kasahara and Kumiko, or are they just puppets?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Why is that?  It could be me &#8212; purely.  I tend to read novels once, against Navokov&#8217;s advice, so it is possible that reading the book a second time brings the old boredom out.  Perhaps I am not mature enough to return over and over to the same favorites.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yet it seems that the opposite is true, and I have grown up.  After reading <em>Wind-up Bird</em> in 2003, I set off driving down the West Coast to visit family in southern California.   I was unemployed, having been laid off from my tech job due to outsourcing, and I blubbered to my California family over all the common ills of young adulthood, most of which came down to no money and lack of purpose.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Since then, I have witnessed the death of my father, traveled to Ghana, met my loving wife, watched in horror as the dollar declined.  And I saw &#8212; for the first time in my life &#8212; the man I voted for as President elected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In the aftermath of  all these big, serious life events I seem to be left wondering, why is this book so remote?  It can&#8217;t just be the translation: I read all his other stuff through that gauze; even this book.  No, I think it&#8217;s Murakami&#8217;s style.   His chained-together dreams, the way he always seems to grope in the dark for the next invented metaphor &#8212; these tics rub against me in the sentences and pages as Kim and I read them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  What I want now is something real, something concrete, as Toru Okada, the protagonist of <em>Wind-up Bird </em>might say.  I suppose that means it is time to buy Murakami&#8217;s latest book, which in a strange contrast to most of his work is a <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/18-9780307389831-0">non-fiction title on running</a> (with a name that puns Raymond Carver&#8217;s famous short story, &#8220;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&#8221;).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A book on running?  No supernatural underworld, unexplained phenomena, one-armed men or disappearing shadows?  Oddly enough, that sounds exactly like what I want at this moment in my life.
