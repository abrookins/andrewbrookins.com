A year ago, I set out to write _the book_ on Django database performance.

Not just another boring technical book: this would be something special, a mashup of deep technical content and fantasy table-top gaming.

After 11 months of grueling nights and early mornings, including half a year of sleep torture as a new parent, I finally finished [The Temple of Django Database Performance](https://spellbookpress.com/books/temple-of-django-database-performance/) this November.

One reader described it like this:

> The Temple of Django Database Performance is a must read for anyone working with Django. Youâ€™ll learn about profiling, query plans, indexing, and the Django ORM. Very approachable for those with only modest experience but even the experts should learn something new.

> -- Tristan Waddington, Developer Experience Lead

You can grab the ebook bundle (EPUB, MOBI, and PDF) or print bundle (full-color print edition plus all ebook files) from the Spellbook Press web site, or print-only from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Temple-Django-Database-Performance/dp/1734303700/).

Bundles purchased from Spellbook Press include the full AsciiDoc source code of the book, high-resolution images, and all of the example code.
